	The parents of 1,126,501 New York City public school students are nervous about sending their children to in-person hybrid classes during the COVID-19  pandemic.  The Department of Education has been trying to assuage their fears, but major concerns remain.  About 46% of parents have opted for remote-only learning.  Many parents feel they haven't been given a voice.</h2>
